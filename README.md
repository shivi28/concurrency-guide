##CONCURRENCY GUIDE

This repository is a collection of practical concurrency scenarios in Go.

The examples are inspired by the concurrency section of Effective Go (https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#concurrency
), but the scope goes beyond that guide. Each scenario was developed through deep dives into the concepts, discussions around real-world use cases, and iterative exploration of concurrency patterns.

Feel free to explore the examples, experiment with them, and contribute your own scenarios if you have ideas to add.

⚡ Friendly & Open-Source Vibe

This repo is a growing collection of real-world concurrency scenarios in Go.

While it’s inspired by the concurrency patterns from Effective Go (https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#concurrency
), it goes beyond the basics. The examples here came from exploring those ideas in depth and brainstorming practical situations where they show up in everyday Go code.

Give it a spin, play around with the examples, and feel free to contribute more scenarios if you’ve got cool ideas to share 🚀

🧠 Learning-Focused

This repository explores common and practical concurrency scenarios in Golang.

The initial inspiration comes from the concurrency section of Effective Go (https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#concurrency
), but the examples here are extended into hands-on, real-world situations. These scenarios were created through detailed discussions and experimentation to better understand how Go’s concurrency primitives behave in practice.

Try out the examples, break them, fix them, and contribute new scenarios to help others learn.
